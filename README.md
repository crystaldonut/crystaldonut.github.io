# Main Website

#### Remarks

This website was 'hastily' created using nextjs; i looked at the jekyll oferring and it did not present the customizability I wanted it demanded to look more under the hood, so I decided to instead use what I know right now instead of wasting precious time

This website is using tailwind as its main styling and some dependencies for reading md files

Development of the website was done in my part time since I am working on other HW projects

Below is a roadmap that I moved from my Notion to github
