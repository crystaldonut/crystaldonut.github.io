## Notes on Mobile Development

Mobile development has always been part of my professional formation; I specialized early on on development of iPhone apps using my prior knowledge of Objective_C from back in my app development days; when google's material design became stable I begun working with android.

Google Flutter 
I saw in flutter a great way of taking advantage of my hardware specific api skills to augment classic flutter apps with hardware specific requirements needed at the earliest days of that platform

## Notes on Dektop Development

Working with mac and windows was something that brought me joy when I was starting in my career; developing with Objective_C (arc) and early day C++ (before managed code became a thing) was very challenging, since you had to work with memory by yourself without any nets 

I also worked with Assembly since I wanted to learn how to create low level funtions before using professional libraries.

eg char manipulation vs String Class (back in the day...)
