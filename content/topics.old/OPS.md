My involvement working with Infrastructure has been very fulfilling (and very stressful). Infrastructure orchestration appeased my sense of order by obsessing with automation and one-key deployments; it was fun, like tuning a racecar 🏎️...

In the beggining I taught myself Ruby so i could create some macross way back when Mobile CI was not very much developed, currently I use Typescript and YAMLS for CDK and Docker/Cloudformation work respectively

### Script Languages

| Script Language  |       | Total Years used | Active |
| :----------------- | :--------------- | ------: |------: |
| YAML |  |   6 | ✅ |
| Typescript |  |   3 | ✅ |
| Ruby |  |   1 | |

### Orchestration 

I have to admit the AWS CDK is fun; I liked the posibility of creating non declarative infrastructure and more programmed infrastructure. Also my experiece with YAML ported naturally from my old days of Swagger to delighfully using it with Docker Compose & Ansible Playbooks

| CDK |  |   4 | ✅ |
| Docker |  |   4 | ✅ |
| Docker Compose |  | 4 | ✅ |
| Ruby | Basic |   1 | |
| Fastlane |  |   2 | |
| Ansible | | 1 | ✅ |

### Fleet deployments

For a previous client there was a need to perform some basic fleet deployment and securing of employee desktops/laptops I was lucky to be able to assist a developer specializing in devops and achieve this using a remote fleet configuration using ansible. Installing company keys in a secure environment (such as a keyring for example) and then use that to be able to install required passwords and in some cases access keys for accessing systems.

This was developed for a client company in the field of education

## Intra-bots

Sometimes there is a need to create automations inside internal communication tools for the benefit of the developer/teams I have been able to do this using the Slack protocol for creating pipeline interfacing with AWS via lambda

### Infrastructure 

This is an emerging knowledge in my end; Having been exposed to tech such as nginx a while I have kept busy by setting up dockerized nginx containers for my personal projects that required ssl certificates. 

In GraphQL things are getting interesting lately. I initially started with a declarative JSON graphql schema, however new tendencies are moving towards programmable schema which in my personal opinion are much more versatile and alleviate the unecesary usage of SuperGraphs for projects that dont really need it.

I have been experimenting lately with Strawberry GraphQL and Python. At the same time I have been dabbling with establishing a future Data Ingestion layer for my future projects which is why Apache Nifi has caught my attention. 

Just loads of Fun!
