At the time of this writting (July '24) I am currently working on several projects (im always keeping busy) some of these projects are for private clients and most for my personal knowledge base

Some things im working on:

- Computer Vision
- Embedded Computing (Pi)
- OSS Social Networks Implementation (Mastodon,Lemmy)
- Ansible Experiments with edge systems
- Large network management with nginx
- Playing with GODOT
- Non declarative GraphQL
- Kubernetes Experiments

I will most likely create a youtube channel and a more personal specialized website (some people call these blogs ðŸ¤£ ) to highlight some of the above experiments since its more fun to show and tell than to just yap about it ðŸ˜…

Stay Tuned!
