In the last 5 years or so, I have been working with AWS a lot. My main responsabilies varied from developer to software designer/architect and infrastructure developer.

The lists below represent my experience with AWS

### Script Languages

I specialized in python more so than Node due to its speed I have worked with python since the early days around 2002 (game development) however I took a break and came back in the late 2010s and used its later iterations for enterprise development

Some Apis I have used (the list is infinite so i will state only the common ones used today):
**Requests**
**Flask**
**Boto3**
**FastAPI**
**Math**
**Numpy**
**Pillow**
**OpenAI**

| Python 3         |      | 6 | ✅ |
| Node         |      | 2 | ✅ |

### Authentication

In some cases there have been clients/employers that have requested bespoke authorization frameworks. Keeping to the standard OAuth I have been able to work with several tools according to strategic needs of the case, items such as privacy, development cost and infrastructure cost have always been determining factors
