In the past five years, I have extensively worked with AWS. My responsibilities have spanned across roles, including developer, software designer/architect, and infrastructure developer.

The lists below represent my experience with AWS

### Script Languages

I have specialized in Python, favoring it over Node.js due to its speed and versatility. My experience with Python dates back to the early 2000s, where I initially used it for game development. After a hiatus, I returned to Python in the late 2010s, leveraging its advanced features for enterprise development.

Some of the APIs and libraries I've commonly used include:
- Requests
- Flask
- Boto3
- FastAPI
- Math
- Numpy
- Pillow
- OpenAI

This list is not exhaustive, as my experience spans a broad range of tools and technologies.


| Script Language  |       | Total Years used | Active |
| :----------------- | :--------------- | ------: |------: |
| Python 2*         |      | 6 | ✅ |
| Python 3         |      | 6 | ✅ |
| Node         |      | 2 | ✅ |


### Authentication

In some instances, clients or employers have requested custom authorization frameworks. While adhering to the standard OAuth protocol, I have worked with various tools tailored to the strategic needs of each case. Factors such as privacy, development cost, and infrastructure cost have always been critical in determining the appropriate approach.

| Auth System  |       | Total Years used | Active |
| :----------------- | :--------------- | ------: |------: |
| Python Based OAUTH 2FA         |     | 5+ | ✅ |
| AWS Cognito         |      | 2 |  |
| AuthO         |      | 3 |  |
| Okta         |      | 1 |  |
| Keycloak         |      | 4 | ✅ |
| Providers (Goog,FB,APPL,SLACK)         |      | 7+ | ✅ |




### AWS APIS

My work has primarily focused on development using the Boto3 Python library.

| Service  |       | Total Years used | Active |
| :----------------- | :--------------- | ------: |------: |
| Boto3 |  |   6 | ✅ |
| AWS SDK for JS |  |   2 |  |

### AWS Services 

Working with AWS provided me the opportunity to explore a wide range of services offered by the platform. Discovering new services has been an exciting and engaging experience, as I aimed to utilize as many tools as possible to meet business requirements effectively.
