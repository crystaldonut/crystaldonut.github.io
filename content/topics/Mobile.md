## Notes on Mobile Development

Mobile development has been a key aspect of my professional growth. I initially specialized in developing iPhone apps, leveraging my prior experience with Objective-C from my earlier app development days. As Google's Material Design matured, I expanded my skills to include Android development.

Google Flutter presented a unique opportunity to leverage my hardware-specific API skills to enhance classic Flutter apps. I utilized these skills to address hardware-specific requirements, particularly during the early stages of the platform's development.

## Notes on Dektop Development

Working with both macOS and Windows has been a source of great joy for me since the beginning of my career. Developing in Objective-C (using ARC) and early C++ (prior to the introduction of managed code) was particularly challenging, as it required meticulous manual memory management without the safety nets provided by modern languages.

I also delved into Assembly programming to understand the creation of low-level functions before relying on professional libraries. For instance, I explored the differences between manipulating characters directly versus using a String class, gaining a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of programming "back in the day."
