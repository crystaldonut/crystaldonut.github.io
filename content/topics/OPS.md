My experience with infrastructure has been both fulfilling and challenging. Infrastructure orchestration appeals to my sense of order, and I enjoy the process of automating tasks and setting up one-key deployments; it's akin to tuning a racecar üèéÔ∏è. However, I've primarily served as an associate or assistant in infrastructure roles, as being on call 24/7 would require significant compensation at this stage of my career. My brother is a doctor, so I understand the seriousness and demands of being on call.

In the early days, I taught myself Ruby to create macros when mobile CI was still underdeveloped. Currently, I use TypeScript and YAML for AWS CDK and Docker/CloudFormation work, respectively.

### Script Languages

| Script Language  |       | Total Years used | Active |
| :----------------- | :--------------- | ------: |------: |
| YAML |  |   6 | ‚úÖ |
| Typescript |  |   3 | ‚úÖ |
| Ruby |  |   1 | |

### Orchestration 

I have to admit that working with the AWS CDK is quite enjoyable. The ability to create programmatically defined infrastructure rather than relying solely on declarative approaches is exciting. 

That said, my previous experience with YAML, particularly from working with Swagger REST APIs, made it an easy transition to using YAML with Docker Compose and Ansible Playbooks.

### Fleet deployments

For a previous client in the education sector, there was a need to perform basic fleet deployments and secure employee desktops and laptops. I had the opportunity to assist a developer specializing in DevOps to achieve this using remote fleet configuration with Ansible. We implemented a secure environment, such as a keyring, to store company keys, allowing for the installation of necessary passwords and, in some cases, access keys for system access.

This experience involved:

- Setting up a secure method for deploying company-specific configurations and credentials across multiple devices.
- Ensuring the security and integrity of sensitive data during the deployment process.
- Collaborating closely with DevOps specialists to streamline and automate the deployment process.

| Ansible-Conditionals | | 1 | ‚úÖ |

## Intra-bots

There are times when automations within internal communication tools are needed to benefit developers and teams. I've been able to implement such automations using Slack's API, creating bots that interface with AWS services via Lambda. These intra-bots facilitate communication, and integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, enhancing productivity and efficiency.

### Infrastructure 

This area is an emerging field of expertise for me. Having been exposed to technologies like Nginx a while ago, I've kept myself busy by setting up Dockerized Nginx containers for personal projects that required SSL certificates.

In the realm of GraphQL, recent developments have been particularly intriguing. Initially, I worked with declarative JSON GraphQL schemas, but I've noticed a shift towards programmable schemas. In my opinion, these programmable schemas offer greater versatility and reduce the need for SuperGraphs in projects that don't require them.

Recently, I've been experimenting with Strawberry GraphQL in Python, exploring its potential for creating efficient and flexible APIs. Additionally, I've been exploring the possibility of setting up a future data ingestion layer for my projects, which has led me to experiment with Apache NiFi. This exploration into various technologies has been a fascinating and enjoyable journey.
