Well the web has not been my main specialty for many years; simply because of old style javascript work back in the day was very much difficult and frustrating due to how unstable web standards were (im dateing myself) 

Today thanks to WebKit and Chromium things are much more calmer; bringing opportunities to make amazing web applications. 

Web Applications are now a combination of Great UX, UI Standards and accelerated DOM

I started working with React in 2020. The rendering speeds blew me away. Currently im working with NextJS on my personal projects, however remix, htmx and wasm with rust are lately on my radar, but i will wait for a little longer until it becomes more a thing if ever...
