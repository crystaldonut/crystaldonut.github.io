Web development hasn't been my primary focus for many years, largely due to the challenges and frustrations I experienced with early JavaScript work and unstable web standards (I'm dating myself here). However, the advent of modern browsers like WebKit and Chromium has stabilized these standards, creating new opportunities for developing amazing web applications.

Today, web applications are a blend of excellent UX, standardized UI design, and accelerated DOM rendering. I began working with React in 2020 and was impressed by the rendering speeds and efficiency it offered. Currently, I'm using Next.js for my personal projects, but I'm also keeping an eye on emerging technologies like Remix, HTMX with GO, and WebAssembly (Wasm) with Rust. 

While these are exciting developments, I plan to wait a bit longer before diving into them fully, to see how they mature and fit into the broader web development landscape.
