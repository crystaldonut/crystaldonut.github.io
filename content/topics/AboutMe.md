## üë§ About Me

Hello, I'm Ivan. A seasoned software developer with a rich history in various programming languages, software APIs, and applications. My journey in tech has taken me through diverse teams and cities worldwide, enriching my experience and broadening my perspective.

### üí° What I Do

I specialize in solving complex problems and have developed numerous applications and libraries that significantly enhance user experiences. My passion lies in translating abstract ideas into concrete solutions with real-world applications. I thrive on the challenges of software development, where perfection is unattainable but excellence is a commitment.

### üìö My Philosophy

I believe in purpose-driven software architecture. My approach is straightforward: translate ideas into reality efficiently and with high engineering integrity. I am not fixated on being labeled an "expert" in any one language because true expertise comes from the ability to strategize, execute, and evaluate impactful solutions in a determined scope. The Integration of all these 'scopes' are the main driver of software architecture robustness.

My Path to Success:

Research
Strategize
Execute

In order to be able to achieve this path one must be genelized in a task (say for example a general senior python developer) then specialize on solving the problem itself. This has worked for me troughout my career.

## üîß Skills and Technologies

While my website contains a comprehensive list of languages and tools I've mastered, my core competency lies in problem-solving. Whether it's small startups or visionary companies, I excel in environments that value innovation and practical results.

### ü§ù Leadership and Collaboration

I have frequently donned the "product hat," leading teams and empowering colleagues to achieve their best for their organizations. My tenure at each company reflects my commitment to seeing projects through to their successful conclusion. 

## üìà Professional Background

- **Past Experience:** My career includes long tenures at companies where I've engaged in multiple projects, showcasing my dedication to project completion and value addition.

- **Education:** I hold a BS in Game Development with a Minor in Game Design from 2007. Beyond formal education, I've taught subjects like OpenGL, Git, CDK, Python, and software engineering to students and professionals.

## üéØ My Commitment

I am committed to solving whatever challenges come my way. My work is my pledge to every employer: I solve problems not just with code, but with creativity and dedication.

### ‚ùó Note on Expertise and Hiring

I avoid traditional assessments like live coding tests or even some take-home exams, as my extensive portfolio and professional history speak to my capabilities. I focus on substantial metrics such as software architecture and alignment with company vision, rather than mere lines of code.
